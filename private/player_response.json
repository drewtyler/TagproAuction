I think 9 pacific would be the latest I would be willing to start and I would prefer the games to be before 8.\nThe days I said I was available on the draft packet is very conservative. Most likely I will be available most week days.\nI would not nominate myself for the first round of the draft. I'm not saying you shouldn't pay whatever you think a fair price is for me if I am nominated, but I am a bad judge of talent. I think you would be better off nominating/drafting someone who is a better drafter in the first round.",

My biggest weakness is sometimes I make questionable choices which I think is just a lack of time spent with a larger variety of high level players to learn how they handle very specific situations.  My biggest strength is probably positioning in close call situations and preventing caps from their side.  I'm very comfortable defending from the regrab position.",

    "note":"Being in minors this year helped me grow quite a bit as a player. I thoroughly enjoyed the higher level of competition, and I'd really like another chance to show my stuff. I'm really not interested in being drafted onto a team where I will ride the bench the majority of the season. I'm too competitive to not play. If that's something that makes me undraftable to you...I guess that's just how it is. I'm able to earn my spot as a starter, I just don't want to be drafted as a back up with no chance of making the starting line up, or at least no chance of decent playing time. :)\n\nThank you for your consideration. <3",

    "note":"I'm looking forward to another season of competitive tagpro! I came in during the honeymoon push and I played in S2 of NLTP and S6 of minors and had a blast both times. I can't wait to continue playing tagpro in this great community we have and helping to better it each day. I love bonding with fellow tagpro players and being a part of fun teams who play well together. As an offender, you can't go wrong having me around -- I like to think my strengths are my evading skills and game awareness. I would prefer to play on a team that bases its practices on east coast or central time. Thanks!",

Also, if you find yourself as a captain, getting angry a lot at us players, that shit don't fly with me. I understand you want to compete but there's a better way of going about things. \n\nI like to drink (I don't get drunk during games or most practices) and have fun. If you can't seem to find the fun in this, then don't even bother with me for my sake. Best of luck for the 2014 MLTP everyone! ",

I work nights as a chef and wouldn't even regularly be able to make practices for any teams that have them before 9pm PAC time.

Radius and PI tend to hover around 100-110.   I played in top of the class for defense on B team for CREAM in NLTP this season and in the last 4 games i played almost solely offense as we were short handed and I have been working on that skillset in pubs/PUG's almost exclusively when I can get away with it.

I played on game in NLTP B playoffs (Nevermores) last season and capped with 25 FPS and 350 ping (I was playing in Thailand with my old laptop I had with me in a hotel). This season I played a lot more NLTP B (would have played A, but the schedules weren't as good for me), and I'm now candidate for a few awards, including MVB and best O. Ask my 21 Juke St. teammates (or any other who have played with me a lot) if you aren't sure if I am good enough for MLTP. I have been playing in the RLTP since the beginning (I was drafted as VC by Fronj in the beta season). I've played also in S2 eLTP (we won the league, I didn't have mic yet), and I was the best O player according to GASP, also nominated for best O and MVB. This season I've played in Blockburn ELTP team, we came 3rd in the league. I've also played in CC, many tournaments, PUGs and some ranked pugs now that Lej published it (I was in top30 when I last played, few days after the release). Usually I play half of my pubs on US servers, and my monthly win % has stayed at 65-80 for few months. I have played O in almost all the competitive games, and I'm better on it. I can play D well, but I'm not one of the best in Europe in it, so it would be a waster to draft me for D. I can and have switched to D in league games when necessary though, and it works fine. It would be best to be drafted for Radius team, but I can handle the Sphere ping if necessary. I don't know yet if I can attend the try-outs (I missed them all last season), so if you are interested in drafting me, send me a PM on reddit to ask when I could come to play.",

I will say that I am trying to cut back on how much time I spend on this game, but I think not being a captain will take care of most of that.\n\nMy main strengths are defense and good communication, but if the team needs it, I am comfortable playing O. Heck, I'd probably play O in NLTP if that's where I end up.\n\nI'm in Chicago, so I get good ping to basically any North American server, with Centra being my worst at around 100ish ping.",

My pub stats were awful when I started, so I'm digging out of a big hole, but I'm making huge progress there too.  I'm confident that players who've played with me recently see the vast improvements in my game, both offensively and defensively.  More than that though, I'm reliable, I show up on time to practices and games, and I have a good attitude and want to learn.  Draft me and you won't regret it.",

    "note":"Quite an experienced, well-rounded player who is looking to play D/O in the majors, for I am unavailable to play on weeknights (m/nltp) due to a conflicting work schedule.\n\nI have experience playing competitive tagpro via ranked PUGs (> 100), and have known success doing so. This experience allowed me to understand the underlying dynamics of competitive tagpro, for I am always playing alongside/against major league players. If you doubt my skills as a D/O, I invite you to play some rounds with me. \n\nStrengths: containment, juking, reading players\nCurrently improving: communication and power-up timing\n\nI would consider myself able to contribute to any MLTP team as a good defensive player who will be keeping the flag home (as much as possible) and sneaking in some caps along the way.   \n\n",

My pub win rate has been slowly increasing as well as I've gotten better.\n\nI also want to say I've been looking forward to signing up for this season for a while now.  I didn't feel quite ready for this last season (plus other personal issues that would have prevented it anyways) but I feel good for this one and I'm ready to pop some balls!\n\nOn a personal note, and to be upfront, I have a newborn at home (along with 2 older kids) so I know I'm not going to have a ton of free time to just play whenever.  I know I can make sure to be free at least two or three nights a week for games and practice.  It would have to be nights for me though (not sure if that's the norm or not) due to this.  Hopefully that works out, but I just wanted to make sure that was out there.",

Luckily, my teammates understood, and I was able to get good grades, good enough that I can handle competitive play and high school. \n\nThat being said, I joined in the Honeymoon push (late January), and stepped into the competitive limelight (or lowlight) in March or April. I currently (and have been since the summer) captain a prominent and former champion US Contenders team (Dallas Ballers Club), and, before my departure, was 8th in caps in minors through week 5. \n\nIf you draft me, I'll bring experience, maturity, and most importantly, a good time. Hope to see you soon!",

In Ohio I have no problems with making practices or games but at college I'm never a guarantee but I should be able to make most games should I be needed. I kind of switched to playing more defense lately so I would be fine with playing either spot. Offense used to be what I was good at. I will also be home for two Sunday's in March which means that I would have three weeks of being able to play if needed. \n\nAlso pls draft me I miss tagpro",

    "note":"I feel like I can generally juke better than average, but lets be honest I'm not -Messi (although I did beat him once at ofm....).  My defense is okay, but coordinated players using the disruptions (like bombs) can usually get out of base while I'm guarding.  Both my boost and bomb snipes are pretty good I'd say, but some of the harder boost paths I usually just wind up messing it up.\n\nI feel like there's a lot I need to learn about basic strategy in a highly coordinated game (e.g. not boosting backwards to try to snipe enemy fc... I got yelled at a lot for that in pubs), but I love learning stuff!\n\nAlso, I'm saying I'm available every day of the week because my winter break from college starts next week, so I'm, well, on break :)",
